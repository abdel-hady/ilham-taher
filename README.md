# Getting Started

To initialise the project use the following commands:

- install dependencies

```shell
  npm install
```

- If you run the project locally

```shell
  npm run dev
```
- If you run the project on production

```shell
  npm run build
```
- Then

```shell
  npm run start
```


# Configuration

Make sure to clone `.env` file as `.env.production` or `.env.local` as they override the values
in the `.env` file.
Or you can just use `.env` file and it will work.
